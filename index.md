# The Journey of a Novel: How I wrote _The Trinity of Fundamentals_
Wisam Rafeedie

“There are no coincidences.”
That necessity lurks behind chance is a deeply rooted philosophical mantra which we may sometimes use to console ourselves when coincidence inspires optimism, or the expectation of a happy event.
On the other hand, it may indeed be a coincidence veiling a necessity which must come about.

On the Dhahiriyah Prison bus headed for an-Naqab Prison in 1993, my mind was not occupied with thoughts of writing about my experience of living in hiding for many long years, it was instead filled with other thoughts and sensations: my bladder announcing its need to heed the call of nature.
I wanted the bus to fly rather than proceed on the road.
The situation was loaded with the danger of an unplanned dribble.
My bowels were also ready to discharge their considerable cargo of capsules as we proceeded on the bus to eternity.[^1]
My stomach too was protesting the long journey to which, after many years, it was no longer accustomed.
I was also feeling deep resentment towards the two armed guards engaged in conversation, who were passing the time and laughing in the isolated guards’ compartment separated from us by a screen.

The bus arrived at an-Naqab Prison at noon, where we sat under the searing sun in the waiting section.
Each of us had nothing except for a miserable suitcase and an even more miserable labneh sandwich, and we dreamt many dreams, characteristic of detainees.
We soared in the air only to be brought back to earth and the daily details of the prison.
It was more merciful to walk under the sun rather than to sit in the tent, especially after a long journey and the constant shaking and searches and the inevitable arguments with the guards on the bus.

I had an appointment with coincidence as I was crossing the long distance alone from fence to fence marking the boundaries of the prison, as was my habit of walking there.
Unless memory fails me, as it often does, two inmates came up to me and asked:
“Are you Wisam Rafeedie?”
“Right. I am Wisam Rafeedie.”
To be sure, they asked, “The very same?”
I replied, playfully: “Someone told me I was the only one in the country who goes by this name.”

One of them declared: “I am comrade Ri’fat Ishaq from Beit Sahur and this is comrade Saif Da’na from Hebron.
We would like to walk with you.”

The three of us meandered here and there and talked about the concerns of prison life, politics and the party, with the future of the popular intifada at the heart of the conversation.
They had heard about my experience of clandestine life for nine years and the harsh and lengthy interrogation I had been through.
They were young men, much younger than me.
They had a consuming interest in learning about life in hiding and its rules and conditions, all while observing the party’s requirements of secrecy and safety of which they were well aware.
Suddenly, one of them (I think Rif’at if my memory serves) asked:
“Comrade, why don’t you write about the experience of living in hiding, at least so that our comrades and people can read about and get to know the circumstances of our struggle?”

The idea had not occurred to me before for two reasons which I think are well understood: the first is that clandestine work, and specifically living in hiding, is like squeezing the “I” into a very tight corner so that it can barely lift its head.
When you do not even hear your name mentioned for several years at a time, the self to which the name refers as its identity retreats into the depths.

The second reason is that the interrogations which went on for months had not revealed anything about the world of hiding (or clandestine living) that did not become obvious as a result of my arrest: I was a member of the resistance who did not turn himself in, living in a secret house and carrying on his tasks.
As Abu Sharif, the occupation’s chief of interrogations in Petah Tikva, put it at the end of 1991 on the last day of my interrogation:
“We have learned no more than five percent of what there is to know about you!"
How then should I write about my experience without revealing more than this five percent?

However, after the frank invitation by the two comrades, the subject buzzed around in my head.
Why not write about my experience?
In the final analysis, the self had been assimilated into the group as in a melting pot, so talking about my experience was talking about the group: an experience in organizing a challenge to arrest while providing ideal conditions for the success of the challenge.
In the final analysis I am none other than a single shield in a larger army.
Still not wanting to reveal more than five percent of what there is to know about me, the issue could be solved by writing a novel rather than making a documentary, allowing me to play around with events, names, roles, addresses and other details with the remaining ninety-five percent.

There was another reason why this appealed to me: I was and still am passionate about novels.
I read novels insatiably, savoring every feeling.
I approach reading with critical tools I acquired in my first major: Arabic literature and language.
So, why not write a novel?
More precisely, why not write an autobiographical novel?
Or a novel that is also autobiographical?
It’s just a difference in the wording.
The important thing was to begin.

These thoughts were running through my mind as measures for assigning us into sections proceeded rapidly.
I ended up in section five, or “E” as the prisoners in an-Naqab Prison called it.
After the organizational sorting was over, the comrades arranged a mat for me in the corner overlooking the street separating sections two and five.
A mat in the corner is the privilege of individuals with positions of responsibility in the party, sometimes with seniority.
Perhaps the comrades were pandering to my ego when they chose the corner as the place for my mat, but in the end, the corner satisfied the necessary requirements for me: it was not surrounded by two other mats while I was writing what no one should read.
What was more important was that one mat next to me was better than two from the security perspective.
The mat in the corner also allowed me to read and write at night — and I was a practitioner of both these activities in the camp — due to the strong floodlights trained on the tents at night.
All one had to do was to push the tent flap aside a little and the floodlight would illuminate all the mats.
Consequently, I would be able to read and write at night without causing any additional fatigue to my eyes.
I’ve needed glasses since adolescence and had eye strain from the faint lighting in the prison cells for five months — it would have been fatigue on top of fatigue.

I had an appointment with the floodlight, which illuminated the paper on which I began to explore, scribbling the idea of the novel in my head.
Writing during the day was not easy except during the organizational and cultural sessions when the entire camp was quiet.[^2] But how could I skip those meetings when I was supposed to head them?
The solution was to write at night, as night was the time for all clandestine things: revolutionary activities, love, sex and theft!

I remembered what Hanna Mina once said: a novelist will not begin writing unless he has a general framework for what he is going to write: a plan, a preliminary imagining of the characters and events and the language...
He begins after developing a plan, allowing his pen to intervene a lot, to amend and cross out and develop, what is called internal development of the text as they taught us in the bachelor’s programme.
His words betrayed a bias towards thinking of writing as a product of practice rather than innate ability; that dilemma of criticism in the history of poetry.
I was always an adherent of the former position.

I began with the plan outline.
At which point in time should the novel begin?
Should it be when my house was raided on a rainy night in 1982, and I leapt as though stung to the garden in the back and then to the nearby forest?
Or the day my father died six days before that?
Or should I begin with the visit, two hours before the raid, by a dear friend and comrade and senior leader of the party had come to warn me:
“your man will probably make a confession, do not spend the night at home!”
Or should I leap over the subsequent nine years and start with August 13, 1991, the day the occupation forces raided my secret house?
I was searching for a distinct moment with which to begin the novel so as to capture the attention of the reader, in keeping with what Hanna Mina said:
“If I knew that the reader would fall asleep while reading my novel, I would not write it.”
A catchy observation that shed light on the path ahead: there must be a yearning suspense in the novel, otherwise it would be closer to a dry news report, particularly as it was, in the end, an autobiography.

I thought I had found the solution: I would begin with the time of the raid on the secret house in 1991, when I lay blindfolded on the floor in the house.
I, with my hands tied, and them, roaming the house, destroying things in their search.
Then I would go back to 1982 and follow a chain of events that would lead back to the starting point.
The incidents were two doors, a door on which they banged forcefully in 1982 and a door which they unhinged in 1991, and between them was a life, revolution and buried desires, points of weakness and strength, debates and fatigue, worries and happiness...
a life the full extent of which I lived within the strict limits allowed by the rules of living in hiding and within the narrow physical limits of the house in which I was a prisoner.

And so it was.
I began to write according to this plan.
I would write and tear up the pages, time and again.
The problem of supplying the paper I needed at a time when paper was scarce was a matter that required extraordinary planning.
Once again, as in the case of the corner mat, my classification as a party official improved the novel’s fortunes.
The party organization was generous in providing paper and copybooks.
When I was fully satisfied with what I had written after many revisions, I copied the material in the copybook.
I practiced my craft secluded from night until the break of dawn, in a corner illuminated by the floodlights.
My papers followed the light shining on the mat just as the sunflower turns towards the sun no matter where it goes.

The quaint complication at the time was that the whole prison found out I was writing a book about my experiences in hiding.
Many developed a strange and ravenous appetite to find out what I was writing.
I clung to my position: no one would read a single word until I made up my mind about two issues: that I had finished writing, and that I wanted it to be read.
And in the end, when I had finished writing, who could guarantee that I would decide to publish?

The new complication was how to hide what was being written and then smuggle it out.
Prison inspections were conducted weekly: a section would be surrounded and we would begin filing out to go to the section facing us, or we would squat in the yard and they would start their futile activity.
They left nothing they did not overturn and scrutinize.
The search focused on items that were prohibited at the time: a piece of iron which we used to trim the mats like would-be carpenters, or a bowl used to make tea or coffee (which were prohibited because lighting a fire was prohibited).
It would be the icing on the cake if they found an organizational capsule or handbook.

Comrade Abul ‘Abed from the Jordan Valley was the “fax guy” in our section.[^3] No sooner did we sense we were being surrounded than he would pick up anything not too heavy that had to be smuggled, tie it to a spherical piece of dough, wrap the ball in plastic and throw it to a nearby section.
It would be picked up by the corresponding “fax guy,” who would conceal it until the inspection was over.
Occasionally the “fax” would fall between the two sections, in which case the fax men had their methods: a long, curved wire that they used to quickly pull back the fax before a guard could reach it if it caught his eye.
We had a revolutionary slogan in those days:
“no white paper in the hands of the administration.”
Intentionally, or even mistakenly, handing over a paper to the military administration, was tantamount to treason.
What extraordinarily daring!

Abul ‘Abed, the man in charge of my novel, was the monitor: as soon as he sensed we were being surrounded he would sound the warning: “It’s getting cloudy!”
That was the warning given by monitors in all prisons.
He would hurry over and “fax” my copybooks as quickly as possible.
If they raided two or even three sections at once, his throwing arm could deal with the situation; it was the arm of a shepherd, unerring in its range and precision.
I would relax once the fax guy on the other side announced: “Got it!”.
My concern was that not a single page I had written should be lost, as I could not rewrite what I had written in the first place with the same emotional fervor or craftsmanship or natural flow...
such is the common wisdom among authors.

I finished writing after about four months of continuously staying up at night and I told the comrades: whoever wants to read it may do so.
The three copybooks began their journey among the prison sections and were avidly read.
Some accepted it as a novel and did not ask about fine details, others were governed by their traditional mores: how could Kan’an kiss his fiancée in the novel?
That is shameful, and aren’t we teaching the comrades to do likewise?
For others it was educational party literature, not literary text, and party education had no place for kissing, naturally.
What shall I say, when Kan’an meets his fiancée after a month in hiding, should we expect him to discuss Lenin’s works with her, for example?
That was my sarcastic reply, and I attached no weight to a position that can only be described as stupid at best.

For the rest of 1992 and up to mid-1993 the novel made the rounds among the sections and was read and well-received by detainees from all organizations, which made me happy.
Throughout that time it jumped from section to section, deceiving the inspectors.
Unfortunately, it had an appointment with an unhappy coincidence.

The copybooks were thrown by fax from section two in the direction of section four during a raid.
The pitcher did not have a strong shepherd’s arm and the bundle fell into the hands of the prison guards.
When I was informed, I thought it was a major catastrophe.
I flared up in anger and exhausted my store of swear words in Arabic.
Months of work gone!
The many emotional reactions and memories that had come flooding into my mind, night after night, were!
I did not have a reserve copy.
The copying department was up to its ears in work copying handbooks and cultural and organizational material, so it was difficult for me to ask them to make copies of my book on top of that.
It was my fault first and foremost rather than that of the comrade who was inept in using the fax.
I refused to blame him and I insisted that the comrades tell him:
“never mind, it only contained five percent.”
However, the party organization had a different take on things; the poor man had to wash the dishes and pots for a week.
He “embraced the sink” for a week, according to the prison lingo.

The entire project was lost before it even saw the light of day, except for a few dozen detainees.
The comrades pressed me to rewrite, to which I had a firm reply: there was no way I could repeat what I had written under the influence of emotions, the analyses and the denunciations— these could only be written once and could not be duplicated.
I was well aware of what I was saying — in writing literature the moment of inspiration is very important, as are the skills of wording and writing.
Inspiration cannot be duplicated exactly, therefore I would not rewrite what I had written.

What bothered me more at the time was that during a meeting of representatives of organizations with the director of the prison camp, Abu Tareq, he provoked me as we were leaving the room by saying:
“I am pleased that my prison includes educated people and writers like you!”
He was hinting that he had the manuscript of the novel.
“Well, I am not happy to be here,” I replied, ignoring the provocation.

Probably military intelligence had informed him of what they had in their possession.
The novel ended up not in the hands of my comrades and the general public but in the hands of a fascistic officer like him!

I had yet another appointment with chance.
I was released in 1994 only to be rearrested 54 days later and placed under administrative detention for a period of four years.
I went from prison to prison many times and settled in ‘Asqalan Prison in 1996.

We, as administrative staff in the party organization, are united by a special relationship.
We follow the party, we are subject to its decisions in all walks of life and we participate in its cultural activities, but we are not assigned organizational tasks within it, nor are we candidates for positions in its leadership organizations or elected to such positions.
Most comrades had heard about the novel and were always encouraging me to rewrite it, but I held fast to my refusal — what was done was done and could not be repeated.
As part of our relationship with the organization at the time, we used to keep up with some of the party correspondence in prisons in case we had something of our own to add.

In 1997, the representative of the organization at the time, Walid Daqqa, came by to deliver a course capsule which had originated in Nafha Prison to me so I could give my opinion of the organization’s cultural program there.[^4] I began to read the capsule, pen in hand to take notes on the subjects offered: Palestinian history, political economy, Leninist studies, the structure of the party, the history of the PFLP, literature...
and here my eyes froze in their sockets: “The Trinity of Fundamentals by Wisam Rafeedie!”
My novel was one of the suggested novels for the educational program, alongside works by the authors Hanna Mina, Ghassan Kanafani, Najib Mahfouz, Gabriel Marquez, Jorge Amado and others.
I took another careful look.
Good.
It’s my novel.
How did it get to Nafha?
Is it the same copy, or what?

I quickly wrote a short letter, via the ‘Asqalan organization to the Nafha organization: Please inform me of the facts concerning the copy of The Trinity of Fundamentals in your possession.
Where did you get it from?
Can you send it to me?

I quickly received a reply.
A comrade from Gaza had been impressed by the novel while he was in an-Naqab Prison in 1993, so he made a copy for himself on capsules and took upon himself the task of smuggling it out when he moved from an-Naqab.
I would get it on the first bus from Nafha to ‘Asqalan.
You could not imagine how happy I was.
It was lost for four years and now it is being returned to me.

However, more significantly, was it the same copy as the one in an-Naqab, or had the process of copying destroyed or dropped some paragraphs, or pages, or, or...

It came to ‘Asqalan Prison in the intestines of four comrades: fifty-two capsules in miniature script.
I devoured it, reading till dawn, checking every word, comma, sentence and event.
It was identical to the original.
I would not be exaggerating if I were to say that my happiness with this was equal to the joy of being set free from administrative detention which went on far too long.

Soon the organization took a decision to have the novel copied in copybooks and to add it to their library, the contents of which are openly listed by the administration, meaning a book would not be subject to confiscation as long as it bore the censor’s stamp.
I had no doubt it would clear the censorship process and be stamped, because the censor is an intelligence agent, his whole concern is focused on material of a military nature and handbooks for training, not literary, political or intellectual material.
Matters turned out the way I expected and I ended up with two copies of the novel, one in miniature and in capsules and the other in the form of copybooks kept by the organization.

## The Second Threat of Confiscation

In mid-1997 it was decided that we would be moved, in our capacity as administrators, to Tel Mond Prison.
My concern was not that ‘Asqalan was better than Tel Mond by any measure you could choose at that time, whether health-wise, socially or administratively.
My overriding concern was how to take the capsules with me.
I was determined to bear full responsibility for that myself and not to enlist the help of anyone else.
Seeing as my stomach could not handle fifty-two capsules, I decided to carry them in a secret pocket in my underwear between my thighs.

I managed to squeeze them in, and we left ‘Asqalan and went by bus to Tel Mond Prison.
The search was quick and not too meticulous: two hands passing over the body without careful checking, more of a formal search than a real one.
I relaxed as the searching began, but what bothered me was that fifty-two capsules were creating a prominent and noticeable bulge between the thighs.
No sooner had the guard begun frisking me than his fingers encountered the lump there.
Speaking in Hebrew he said in astonishment: “what is this?”

What could I have done or said other than what I did:
“Your question is rude, and you are placing your hand in a sensitive place and asking lewd questions, are you gay?”
It was clear that the only part he understood was the English word at the end, which provoked him.
Using good Hebrew and rickety Arabic he yelled: “yish mesho,” and “fi shi” (there is something there).
I stuck to certain words: “You are classless, gay and despicable... where is the officer in charge of you?”
A Druze officer hurried over to find out what the yelling was about.
Raising my voice, I said:
“This policeman is despicable. He intentionally placed his hand in a sensitive area and that is not permissible. I will complain. I will raise a case against him. I want to know his name. This simpleton is yelling in Hebrew “yish mesho” [there is something] and I insist that he should not be lewd with me.”
The officer found nothing to say except “ze maspik” [That’s enough!] and turning to me said:
“It’s over. Go! It’s not worth all this fuss. It’s an unintentional error.”
The guard insisted: “yish mesho”, but the officer ignored him.
The novel was saved in Tel Mond.

It was at Tel Mond that I decided: It should be made public, once and for all!
I asked the detainees and learnt that there was a crack in the visiting room through which copybooks could be passed.
It was fortunate that we were not searched while leaving and had only to pass through a metal detector.
It was a simple matter.
I copied the novel in three copybooks, the metal spines of which I removed.
And so it was that comrade Faizeh visited me in an arranged meeting so as to smuggle the copybooks out while she was leaving the visitors’ room.
The smuggling operation was easy: I concealed the three copybooks around my waist and between my thighs.
My comrades arranged to distract the guards by getting into an argument with them.
In the blink of an eye, I passed the notebooks through the crack and my comrade took charge of them.

The novel finally made it out of prison after a four-year journey, from 1992 to 1997, and was printed in 1998 in Ramallah when I was freed.
It was reprinted in Damascus in 1999.
